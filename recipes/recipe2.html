    <h1>Chocolate Pudding</h1>
    <img src="../img/cp.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rich, silky homemade chocolate pudding made the same way in our family since the 50's. Cooled pudding will form a dark skin on top, which is our favorite part! Top with whipped cream, if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>    
        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>   
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift and whisk sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt together in a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Heat saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk in slowly, whisking constantly until incorporated. Cook, stirring often with a metal spoon, until pudding is noticeably thicker and clings to the spoon, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Divide between 4 small bowls and serve immediately, or chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
