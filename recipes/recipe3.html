    <h1>Rice Cake</h1>
    <img src="../img/rc.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice shaped in triangles or balls filled with your favorite ingredients. Common fillings are pickled plums or salmon but just about anything salty will work and plain is also very tasty. A tasty alternative to the American sandwich and a staple for any bento (Japanese boxed lunch). Store in the refrigerator. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup jasmine rice</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 sheet nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1-inch strips, or as desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 cups water, rice, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking, until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cool rice until easily handled, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a small bowl with water. Place 2 tablespoons of salt in another small bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip hands in water and rub salt over hands. Take a handful of warm rice and form it into a ball. Gently squish ball; with your hands in an "L" or "C" shape, apply gentle pressure to the sides to make a triangle shape.</li>
        <li>Wrap a strip of nori around the triangle, using a bit of water to help it stick if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
